Domain: Retail

Project: The dataset is about a Retail Store where the owner wants to know the probability of a customer making purchase at its store. The owner is also
interested in knowing the amount a customer could spend when visiting the store.

Techniques Used:
Descriptive Statistics
Data Exploration
Data Preparation
Data Manipulation
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree

Summary:
We will build a Decision tree classifier to predict who will be a good customer and who will be bad customer. 

The way we defined the good customer and bad customer is based on the fact, how much they spend relative to the average expenditure of the total population. 
If a person spends more than the average expenditure of the total population, then he is considered as a good customer, and if a person spends less than the 
average expenditure of total population, he is considered as a bad customer

This classification scheme is subjective and every business would turn out with their own unique classification scheme based on some business constraints.
